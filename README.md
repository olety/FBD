# FBD - Facebook data analyzer (dead project)

FBD is a package that contains tools to gather Facebook data using the Graph API and analyze it.

Or at least it was supposed to be. This was an initial project I was going to use for my bachelor's thesis but due to the Facebook's policy I had to change the direction of my research. In general, you could create a ton of observation spots around the globe in order to scrape facebook's location and event data.
